                    <p class="mb-1">Research has shown that over 70% of web traffic is generated by mobile devices, so it only makes sense for software developers to develop mobile applications specifically for these devices. And that is exactly what Mobile development is. Mobile development is simply the branch of software development that deals with developing software for mobile devices like smart phones or tablets. </p>                            
                    <p class="mb-1">As it stands now, the fact remains that research shows that adults spend an average of 3+ hours on their mobile devices daily browsing the web. This is why mobile applications are considered the future of businesses all around the world. The most popular e-commerce platforms like Amazon have already started making use of mobile applications for their business development. </p>
                    <p class="mb-1">Mobile development often involves a series of design and programming processes aimed at creating the best application from scratch in the shortest possible time. </p>
                    
                    <h2 style="margin-top: 4rem;">Types of Mobile development</h2>
                    <p class="mb-1">Mobile Development is generally categorized based on Operating Systems. The two most popular and widely used operating systems are Apple iOS and Google Android OS. Although there are other types of mobile devices out there with different kinds of operating systems, their percentage is very small compared to these two. </p>
                    <p class="mb-1"> Mobile development is therefore divided into two main types, namely Android mobile development and iOS Mobile development. However, there are mobile app developers that are capable of working with both operating systems. </p>
                    
                    <h3 class="mt-2">Android development</h3>

Once the application is finished, it is tested for genera usability and edge cases. </p>
                    
                    <h3 class="mt-2">iOS Mobile development</h3>
